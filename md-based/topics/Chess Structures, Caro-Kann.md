Creating a direct kingside attack. This is often accompanied by placing a knight on the e5 outpost (f6 to evict the knight is weakening), or targeting the weak h7-pawn with the queen and a bishop from d3.<br>

```chess
fen: 8/pp3ppp/2p1p3/4N3/3P4/2PQ4/PPB2PPP/8 w - - 0 1
arrows: c2->h7
```

Gain space with c3-c4, h2-h4, and harmoniously place pieces to control the center:<br>

```chess
fen: 8/pp3ppp/2p1p3/8/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/8 w - - 0 1
arrows: c3->c4 h2->h4
```

Playing c4-c5 to restrict Black's release break ...c6-c5, and to gain control of the d6-square. If White manages to keep Black's counterplay under control, the game will be slow paced and White could even be able to combine some of these plans while Black suffers through passive defence.<br>

```chess
fen: 8/pp3ppp/2p1p3/8/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/8 w - - 0 1
```
