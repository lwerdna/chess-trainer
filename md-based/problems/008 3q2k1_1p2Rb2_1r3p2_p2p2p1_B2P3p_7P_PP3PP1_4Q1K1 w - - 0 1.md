What's white's best move/line?

```chess
fen: 3q2k1/1p2Rb2/1r3p2/p2p2p1/B2P3p/7P/PP3PP1/4Q1K1 w - - 0 1
```

<!-- divider -->

`Be8!`

I had an aspirational line, `Rd7 Qe8 Qxe8 Bxe8 Bd8` and I see the attacked pinned piece. But `Rd7` is easily refuted with like `Qf8` so I failed to even try to falsify things.

Instead the necessary motif is #TrappedPiece on black's light squared bishop, and the surprising move `Be8` wins it.

## Review

This is difficult to spot, but makes for a nice surprise.
