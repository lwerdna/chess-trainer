What's black's best move/line?

```chess
fen: 5rk1/7p/B2Q1bp1/3Pp2r/1N3n2/2P2P2/1P3q2/1K4RR b - - 0 1
orientation: black
```

<!-- divider -->

`Rh2 Rxh2 Qxg1+ Ka2 Qxh2`

I failed this because my pattern/motif pool didn't have #SeventhRank and #MateThreat in it.

## Review

The candidate move suggested by #MateThreat is top, and verified in 1.5 depth.
