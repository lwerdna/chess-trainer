What's white's best move/line?

```chess
fen: 6k1/3r1pb1/p2Pp3/2p1P2p/2p2B1Q/2q4P/P4RK1/8 w - - 0 1
```

* `Qe7 Rxe7 dxe7` and there's no way to stop e8
* `Qe7 {and any other rook move}` wins the rook.

You have elements like exposed king, chaseable queen, but the most important is #AdvancedPawn which is a #PawnWedge (6th and 7th rank) which draws pieces to its attacked squares! #WedgeMagnetism

```chess
fen: 6k1/3r1pb1/p2Pp3/2p1P2p/2p2B1Q/2q4P/P4RK1/8 w - - 0 1
arrows: h4->e7
squares: c7 e7
```

## Reflect, Extend

The #WedgeMagnetism pattern suggests the top move, and only 2 moves of lookahead are needed to verify, mainly that queening can't be stopped and there is no counterplay.
