What's white's best move/line?

```chess
fen: 1r3k2/1P2bppp/3p4/NP2p3/4n3/6P1/1B3P1P/3R2K1 w - - 0 1
```

`Rc1 {threatening Rc8+ and queening} Nc5 Rxc5 dxc5 Be5.

The #WedgeMagnetism pattern again, with the fastest path to occupying those squares being Rc1:

```chess
fen: 1r3k2/1P2bppp/3p4/NP2p3/4n3/6P1/1B3P1P/3R2K1 w - - 0 1
squares: a8 c8
```

## Reflect, Extend

It's an ideal situation: #WedgeMagnetism suggests the top move and only 2.5 depth is required to check it.
