Whte just played Qh3, what's black's best reply?

```chess
fen: r1bq1rk1/pp1nbp1p/2p3pQ/3pP3/5B2/2PB4/PPP3PP/2KR2NR b - - 0 1
arrows: g5->h6
orientation: black
```

<!-- divider -->

Nxe5!

Easy piece blob analysis finds that white's Q and K are in a danger shape, so his dark square bishop is not a real defender:

```chess
fen: r1bq1rk1/pp1nbp1p/2p3pQ/3pP3/5B2/2PB4/PPP3PP/2KR2NR b - - 0 1
arrows: h6->c1 c1->h6
squares: h6 f4 d3 d1 c1 g1 h1
orientation: black
```
