White just played Rd1, what is white's best response if black replies `...Bc3`? What should he have played instead?

<!-- divider -->

`Rxe8 Rxe8 Rd7`

The idea you must spot is the #PawnWedge on c6, creating strong points on b7 and d7, attracting pieces through #WedgeMagnetism.

He fell victim to the reflexive "dodge, re-attack" response, which is often good, but not always. `...Rxe1 Rxe1` is the easiest de-escalation. With `...Bf6` black holds the 7th: `...Bf6 Rxe8 Rxe8 Rd7 Re7`.

## Reflect, Extend

With eyes on the #WedgeMagnetism pattern, it's only a 1 move lookahead (Rxe8 Rxe8) to get on the 7th.
