How do you respond/defend to threats according to Danya:

1. Move that piece

2. Defend with another piece
3. Intercept one of the attackers (Interference)
4. EST - Equal or stronger threat

In the situation with two hanging pieces, the act of throwing one piece away for as much material as possible is called desperado.
