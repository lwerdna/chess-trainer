In closed positions (think French advance, Caro-Kann advance):

* the king is sometimes safer in the center, do not always castle early!

* knights are often better than bishops
* each move is less critical, so maneuvering and "small plans" become more executable

In IQP positions:

* IQP holder wants to control the diagonal behind the IQP ... so if white has IQP on d4, he wants to control b2-h7 diagonal

Given different pawn pushes, choose the ones that move to the opposite color of your bishop (or, if you have two bishops, opposite the color of the one you're least likely to trade).
