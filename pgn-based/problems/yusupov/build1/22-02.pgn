{ <0> } 1. Ba4+ { White can eliminate the c, d pawns and turn the b pawn into
an a pawn! } 1... Kc7 2. Bxd7 ( 2. Kd5 $4 d6 ) 2... Kxd7 3. a6 ( 3. Kd5 $4 { Black's king will be too close when we try to trade the a pawn. } 3... c4 4. Kxc4 Kc6 { Too close! } 5. a6 b6 6. a7 Kb7 7. a8=Q+ Kxa8 8. Kb5 Kb7 { And
we're dead. } ) 3... bxa6 4. Kd5 Kc7 5. Kxc5 Bd3 6. Kb4 { Very hard.

Need to recognize you're down and a #FortressI is possible if black's b-pawn can be lured to a rook pawn.

Look3 to see that the c, d pawns can be assassinated, but also timing an a6 correctly so the enemy king is too far to help. } *
