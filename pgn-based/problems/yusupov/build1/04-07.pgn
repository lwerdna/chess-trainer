{ <0> } 1. h6 ( 1. Ke1 $4 f4 { and black accesses the g, h pawns } ) 1... Ke4 ( 1... f4 2. g6 Kf6 3. gxh7 { </0> } ( 3. g7 $4 Kf7 ) ) ( 1... Kf4 2. g6 { </0> } ) 2. g6 { That initial 1.h6 move accomplished several things:

1.  Creates a two-on-one #BreakThrough threat
2.  Black is now three moves from g5 and white
will make it to f4 in time. 
3. White holds opposition since corresponding f5
is occupied.

It's also difficult to see that the doubled pawns actually defend
themselves surprisingly well against the pursuing K. } *
