square highway to a1 if b pawn becomes a rook pawn, or to support the N escape
to b3, provided black doesn't get opposition after. } ) 2. Na5+ bxa5 3. Kd2 { white takes dark squares to a1 for the #WrongBishop draw } 3... Kc5 4. Kc1 Kb4 5. Kb2 a4 6. Ka1 a3 7. Kb1 Kc3 8. Ka1 { That Kc2 instead of Kc3 is very hard. You must make sure when the N is saved from being dominated, you don't give him opposition.

With the K@d2, you can take one (Kc3) or two (Kc2, Kc3) moves to get to the meeting spot. } *
