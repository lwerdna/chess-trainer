1. Nxg7 Kxg7 2. Nd4 { The f3 knight gets to f5 with #TempoDash } 2... Qc8 3. Nf5+ Kg8 4. Qg3+ Ng4 5. Qxg4+ Bg5 ( 5... Rg6 6. Nxe7+ ) 6. Ne7+ { Very difficult but a cool concept.

Nd4 obviously threatens the Q, but then what?
Instead, Nxg7 first, and then Nd4  #ThreatTeleport to f5, replacing the other. } *
